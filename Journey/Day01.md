- The DevOps Cycle
    - Integration of two fields within a software delivery
        - **Software Development**
            - Plan → planning your software
            - Code → writing the code + tests
            - Build → building the software i.e. compiling the code
        - **Operations**
            - Release → deployed on the server
            - Operate → actual running of your app
            - Monitoring → observing & tracking the performance
        
        & then this starts all over again when we want to create something on top of the application
        
        - What more can we add?
    
    **Plan > Code > Build > Test > Release > Deploy > Operate > Monitor  > Plan . . .**
